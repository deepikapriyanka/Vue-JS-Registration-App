# Crossbeam Frontend Engineer Challenge

## Instructions

This repo contains a skeleton Vuejs project. Your task is to modify the code so
that the page contains a very simple phone book. Users should be able to enter
a person's name and phone number and be able to add and delete users from the
list.

You will be scored on the following, ranked from most important to least:

- Is the code simple and well written?
- Does it work / is all requested functionality present?
- Does it look good?

To work on and submit the project, please:

- Clone this repository
- Make your changes
- Email a patch file with your changes to buck@getcrossbeam.com
